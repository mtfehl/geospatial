# Class: Geospatial DS & Economic Spatial Models

This repo serves as a workspace for the term 2 course at Barcelona School of Economics Masters in Economics: Geospatial Data Science & Economic Spatial Models. 
It includes my personal notes, and projects, and problems sets in class.
The repo also serves to host and build a website to host my notes, that link to my portfolio.
